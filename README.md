# Smart_traffic_management_system


Overview

The Smart Traffic Management System is a machine learning-based application designed to optimize traffic flow by predicting congestion and suggesting better traffic control strategies. The system utilizes real-time traffic data and applies data-driven insights to enhance traffic management efficiency.

Features

Traffic Congestion Prediction: Uses machine learning algorithms to analyze traffic patterns.

Real-time Monitoring: Displays live traffic data.

Smart Signals: Adjusts traffic signal timing dynamically.

User-Friendly Interface: Developed using Streamlit for easy interaction.

Integration with External Data Sources: Fetches traffic data from APIs or sensors.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit

Backend: Python (Flask/Streamlit)

Machine Learning: Random Forest, Decision Tree, or Neural Networks

Database: SQLite / PostgreSQL (optional for storing traffic data)

Deployment: ngrok (for temporary public hosting)


Installation

1. Clone the Repository :  git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-traffic-management.git
cd smart-traffic-management

2. Install Dependencies  : pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Application : streamlit run app.py

4. Expose the Application using ngrok (For Google Colab Users) : !ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
                                                                  from pyngrok import ngrok
                                                                  public_url = ngrok.connect(8501, "http")
                                                                  print("Access the Streamlit App Here:", public_url)
